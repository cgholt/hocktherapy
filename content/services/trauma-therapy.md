  Does This Sound Familiar?




  * You feel constantly on edge, even when nothing is happening.

  * You react more intensely than the situation calls for.

  * Certain memories feel frozen in time and still carry the same charge.

  * You avoid specific places, conversations, or topics without fully knowing why.

  * Sleep is difficult. Your body never fully relaxes.

  * You feel detached from people you care about.

  * You struggle with sudden anger, shutdown, or emotional numbness.

  * You replay events in your mind, wishing you had acted differently.

  * You blame yourself for what happened or for how you responded.

  * You tell yourself to “just get over it,” but your nervous system refuses.




  Trauma is not a sign of weakness. It is what happens when the body and mind are overwhelmed beyond their capacity to process an experience.




  For many men, trauma does not look like fear. It looks like control, distance, irritability, or silence.




  How Trauma Shows Up for Men


  Men are often conditioned to override pain rather than process it.


  After trauma, this can lead to:


  * Hyper-independence and emotional isolation

  * Increased alcohol use or risk-taking behavior

  * Explosive anger or suppressed rage

  * Loss of sexual desire or performance difficulties

  * Difficulty trusting others

  * Emotional shutdown in relationships

  * A persistent sense of threat or vigilance

  * Feeling fundamentally changed, hardened, or disconnected


  Many men continue functioning at a high level. They work. Provide. Perform.


  But internally, their nervous system remains in survival mode.


  Trauma is not just a memory. It is an imprint on the body. The work is not about reliving everything endlessly. It is about helping your system learn that the danger has passed.




  How I Work & Why This May Be a Fit




  My approach to trauma therapy is structured, direct, and evidence-based. I am formally trained in multiple trauma modalities, including:




  * Written Exposure Therapy

  * Accelerated Resolution Therapy

  * Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy




  These approaches are designed to help the brain and body process traumatic memories in a contained, focused way. They are not open-ended venting. They are targeted and effective.




  At the same time, I work from an existential perspective. Trauma does not only affect the nervous system. It can disrupt a man’s identity, his sense of strength, his trust in the world, and his meaning.




  In our work, we focus on:


  * Regulating the nervous system

  * Processing traumatic memories safely and gradually

  * Reducing avoidance and reactivity

  * Rebuilding a sense of agency

  * Integrating the experience into your life story without letting it define you




  You are not weak for being affected by what happened. You are human.




  The goal is not to erase the past. It is to help you move forward without being controlled by it.




  If you are ready to stop managing symptoms and begin resolving what is underneath them, I invite you to reach out for a brief consultation.




  You do not have to keep carrying it alone.
