title: Existential Psychotherapy
slug: existential-psychotherapy
summary: I focus on understanding your lived experience as you actually
  experience it, rather than fitting you into a diagnosis or predefined model.
  This work is for people who sense their struggles run deeper than symptoms and
  want to live with greater clarity, responsibility, and meaning.

  Existential psychotherapy is for people who feel that their distress cannot be
  reduced to symptoms alone. Many experience life as flat, disconnected, or
  lived on autopilot, without a clear sense of authorship or direction.


  My approach is grounded in Existential Analysis, an approach that starts with your lived experience and treats you as a person, not a diagnosis. I focus on helping individuals come into inner consent with themselves and their lives. In practical terms, this means learning to understand your emotional experience, integrating your personal history, clarifying your values, and taking authentic positions in relation to the world. I do not approach people as problems to be fixed, but as persons capable of responsibility, freedom, and meaningful change.
