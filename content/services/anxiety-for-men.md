  ## Anxiety Therapy for Men


  ### Does this sound familiar?


  You’re functioning... but you don’t feel settled.


  * You carry a constant sense of alertness, like something could go wrong at any moment.

  * Your mind scans the future for threats: work instability, finances, politics, the state of the world, your family’s safety.

  * You feel tense in your body; tight chest, shallow breathing, clenched jaw, stomach issues, headaches, restless energy.

  * Irritability shows up more than fear. You snap, withdraw, or feel fed up with people and systems you can’t control.

  * Sleep doesn’t come easily. When it does, it doesn’t restore you.

  * You don’t think of yourself as “anxious,” but you feel unsettled, burdened, or not quite at home in your own life.


  Many men live with anxiety that isn’t just personal, it’s tied to the world they’re trying to navigate. Economic pressure, responsibility, social instability, cultural expectations, and a sense that the ground is always shifting.


  You’re not imagining this. And you’re not weak for feeling it.


  ### How anxiety often shows up in men


  Anxiety in men is frequently misunderstood by clinicians, by culture, and by men themselves.


  Rather than presenting as constant worry, it often shows up as **embodied tension and behavioral strain**.


  Common expressions include:


  * **Physical anxiety:** racing heart, chest constriction, shortness of breath, dizziness, gastrointestinal distress, muscle tension, chronic fatigue.

  * **Irritability and anger:** anxiety converting into frustration, cynicism, or a short fuse.

  * **Hyper-responsibility:** overworking, overthinking, over-preparing, or feeling unable to rest.

  * **Panic symptoms:** sudden waves of dread, shaking, sweating, numbness, or the sense that you’re losing control or about to collapse.

  * **Disconnection:** emotional numbing, loss of vitality, withdrawal from intimacy, pleasure, or meaning.


  In a world that feels increasingly unstable, anxiety is not a personal failure, it is a human response to uncertainty, responsibility, and exposure to loss.


  Many men are taught to suppress these signals, to push through, self-medicate, or distract themselves. Over time, anxiety doesn’t disappear. It intensifies or goes underground.


  Medication can sometimes reduce symptoms, but when anxiety is treated only as something to suppress, men are left feeling dependent, diminished, or disconnected from their own strength.


  Understanding anxiety differently opens another possibility.


  ### An existential approach to anxiety


  I approach anxiety not as a disorder to eliminate, but as a **meaningful signal,** a response to the realities of being human.


  From an existential perspective, anxiety arises when we confront:


  * Uncertainty about the future

  * Responsibility for our choices

  * Awareness of loss, limitation, or mortality

  * Disconnection from values, purpose, or belonging


  Anxiety is what shows up when life asks something of you before you know how to respond.


  Rather than numbing or outrunning it, our work is to **befriend anxiety and build the courage to meet it**.


  In therapy, we slow things down. We explore what your anxiety is actually about; personally, relationally, and existentially. We work with both mind and body, helping you learn how to stay present with anxiety without being overtaken by panic or avoidance.


  This work is not about positive thinking or endless coping strategies. It’s about developing strength, clarity, and direction.


  Together, we focus on:


  * Understanding anxiety as energy rather than threat

  * Rebuilding trust in your capacity to face difficulty

  * Clarifying values, purpose, and responsibility

  * Cultivating courage in the face of uncertainty

  * Helping you feel more at home in yourself and your life


  Anxiety is not the enemy of freedom. Avoiding it is.


  When anxiety is met with honesty and courage, it becomes a signal for growth, creativity, and meaningful action.


  If you’re ready to stop fighting yourself and start understanding what your anxiety is calling you toward, therapy can be a place to begin.
