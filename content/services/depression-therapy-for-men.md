  ### Does this sound familiar?


  You’re still showing up, but something vital feels muted.


  * You function at work and at home, yet everything feels heavier than it used to.

  * Motivation is low, not because you are lazy, but because effort feels pointless.

  * You feel emotionally flat, disconnected, or empty rather than openly sad.

  * Irritability, frustration, or self‑criticism show up more than tears.

  * You withdraw from people, hobbies, or intimacy without fully understanding why.

  * Your body feels slowed down, tense, or exhausted, even when life looks manageable on paper.

  * You quietly wonder what all of this is for, or whether something meaningful has been lost.


  Many men live with depression that does not announce itself clearly. Instead, it settles in as numbness, disconnection, or a persistent sense that life has narrowed.


  If this resonates, it does not mean you are broken. It often means you have been carrying unspoken loss, pressure, or disillusionment for a long time.


  ### How depression often shows up in men


  Depression in men is frequently misunderstood and underdiagnosed. It does not always look like sadness or despair. More often, it shows up through behavior, energy, and the body.


  Common patterns include:


  * Emotional constriction, numbness, or a sense of deadness rather than overt sadness

  * Irritability, anger, or cynicism that masks underlying pain

  * Loss of drive, initiative, or pleasure, especially in areas that once mattered

  * Physical symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disruption, aches, low libido, or changes in appetite

  * Increased use of work, alcohol, substances, or distractions to escape inner emptiness

  * A quiet sense of shame or failure that is rarely spoken aloud


  Many men are taught to measure their worth through usefulness, strength, or productivity. When life disrupts these foundations through loss, aging, trauma, moral injury, or unmet expectations, depression can emerge as an existential response rather than a medical defect.


  Understanding depression this way shifts the question from what is wrong with me to what has happened to my sense of meaning, direction, or belonging.


  ### An existential approach to men’s depression


  I do not approach depression as something to be suppressed or explained away.


  From an existential perspective, depression often arises when a man becomes disconnected from meaning, values, and agency. It can follow loss, disillusionment, moral conflict, or years of living in ways that no longer feel true.


  Depression is not simply low mood. It is often a collapse of orientation. The future feels closed. Effort feels unjustified. The world loses color because something essential has gone missing.


  In therapy, we take depression seriously without treating you as defective. We slow things down and examine the shape of your life, your history, and the meanings you have been living by. We make space for grief, anger, and disappointment that may never have been named.


  My work blends existential psychotherapy, depth‑oriented exploration, and practical grounding. Together, we focus on:


  * Understanding what your depression is responding to

  * Reconnecting you with values, purpose, and responsibility

  * Restoring a sense of agency and inner authority

  * Working with the body as well as the mind to rebuild vitality

  * Helping you orient toward a future that feels worth engaging with


  I specialize in working with men who feel stuck, detached, or quietly despairing, including men facing identity shifts, trauma, burnout, aging, or loss of direction.


  Depression does not mean your life is over.


  Often, it means your life is asking to be re‑examined.


  If you are ready to understand your depression rather than simply endure it, therapy can be a place to begin rebuilding meaning, strength, and direction.
