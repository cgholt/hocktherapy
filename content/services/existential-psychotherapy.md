  # Does This Sound Familiar?


  * You are functioning on the outside, but feel flat or disconnected on the inside.

  * You’re successful on paper, yet something feels hollow.

  * You wake up already tired of your own life.

  * You feel stuck between responsibility and resentment.

  * You’ve lost a sense of direction and don’t know what you’re aiming at anymore.

  * You feel trapped by roles; husband, father, provider, leader, and unsure who you are underneath them.

  * You question whether your work, your marriage, or your lifestyle actually reflect who you are.

  * You feel a quiet despair you cannot easily explain.

  * You push through, but it feels like survival mode.

  * You sense that something in you wants to change, but you don’t know what or how.


  Many men come to therapy not because they are “broken,” but because they are exhausted from carrying a life that no longer feels fully theirs.


  Existential therapy begins with a simple premise: suffering often arises when a man loses contact with what matters to him and with his capacity to choose how he responds to life.


  # How Existential Concerns Show Up for Men


  Men are often taught to endure quietly. To provide. To perform. To suppress doubt.


  Because of this, existential distress in men rarely looks dramatic. It often appears as:


  * Irritability or low-grade anger

  * Emotional numbness

  * Increased drinking or compulsive behaviors

  * Withdrawal from intimacy

  * Loss of sexual desire or sexual confidence

  * A sense of being trapped or replaceable

  * Quiet thoughts of “Is this all there is?”


  On the surface, life may look stable. Internally, something feels resigned.


  When a man cannot slow down and listen to his experience, life narrows into obligation. He adapts. He survives. But he gradually disconnects from his own vitality.


  Existential therapy creates space to examine that narrowing.


  Rather than reducing your experience to symptoms or diagnoses, we look at how your life is actually lived from the inside. Your history. Your values. Your unspoken beliefs about strength, responsibility, success, and masculinity. The patterns you learned early on. The attitudes you carry without questioning.


  The aim is not analysis for its own sake.


  The aim is clarity.


  Clarity about what you are enduring.


  Clarity about what you are avoiding.


  Clarity about what in you is asking for a response.


  # How I Work & Why This May Be a Fit


  My work is grounded in existential therapy and depth-oriented approaches. I do not see men as collections of symptoms to be managed. I see psychological pain as a signal that something important is at stake.


  I help you:


  * Tolerate and trust your emotional experience rather than outrun it

  * Identify what genuinely matters to you beneath expectation and pressure

  * Examine inherited beliefs about masculinity, strength, and worth

  * Take responsibility for your choices without collapsing into shame

  * Move from passive endurance to active engagement with your life


  Relief often follows not because life becomes easy, but because it becomes yours again.


  I specialize in working with men navigating existential crisis, identity shifts, trauma, and concerns related to sexual health and meaning. My background includes years of clinical work with adult men, and my approach is direct, reflective, and grounded in responsibility rather than blame.


  If you are ready to move from merely getting by to actually living, we can begin there.


  Reach out to schedule a brief consultation and see if this work feels aligned for you.


  ## It is up to you to decide what kind of life you are willing to live.
