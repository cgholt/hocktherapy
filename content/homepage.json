  "aboutContent": " Howdy, most folks call me Jon-Jon. I work primarily with men who feel worn \ndown, disconnected, or stuck, often after years of carrying \nresponsibility, stress, or trauma alone. Many of the men I work with are\n veterans, first responders, or everyday guys who learned to push \nthrough rather than look inward. As a U.S. Army veteran, I understand \nthat culture firsthand. Over time, this can lead to numbness, anger, or a\n quiet loss of self. Therapy here is practical, honest, and reflective. \nPersonal freedom requires taking a position in your own life. I help men\n do that with clarity, grit, and compassion.   \n\nI offer constructive, thoughtful therapy for men seeking real change. Our\n work focuses on clarity, self-responsibility, and understanding how \npast experiences shape present struggles. I help men face what they’ve \nbeen avoiding, reconnect with their values, and respond to life with \nintention. My approach is grounded and non-pathologizing.   \n\nIf you’re ready to stop reacting to life, understand yourself more deeply,\n and take intentional steps toward a steadier sense of self, I invite \nyou to reach out. Therapy here is down-to-earth, principled, and focused\n on your growth, clarity, and resilience.",
