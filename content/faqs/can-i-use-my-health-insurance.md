question: Can I use my health insurance?
answer: I do not participate in insurance panels. This allows me to offer
  therapy in a philosophical, depathologizing style and focus on the deep,
  meaningful work that insurance often doesn’t reimburse. If you have
  out-of-network benefits, you can pay out of pocket and submit a claim to your
  insurance company yourself. I can provide a receipt with the information you
  need for reimbursement, though it will include a diagnosis.
