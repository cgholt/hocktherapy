  Trauma is not only about what happened to you, but about what your system had to do to endure it. When an experience overwhelms your sense of safety, control, or meaning, parts of you may stay on alert long after the danger has passed. This can look like chronic tension, emotional shutdown, sudden anger, difficulty sleeping, intrusive memories, or a feeling that you are never fully present in your own life. Many people carry a quiet confusion about why they react the way they do, especially when others tell them they should be “over it by now.” These responses are not defects. They are signs of a mind and body that adapted to survive when it mattered most.


  A helpful way to understand this comes from Emmy van Deurzen’s image of the tree. Trees are wounded constantly by storms, animals, and human interference. Their exposed limbs are vulnerable to pests, fungi, and the elements. In response, the tree does something remarkable. It redirects its resources toward the injury, forming thick knarled growth around the damaged area in an effort to preserve life. Trauma responses function in much the same way: they demand attention and resources or the system is threatened. What may now feel like rigidity, hypervigilance, or emotional armor once served a vital purpose. Healing is not about cutting these parts away, but about allowing the system to finish what it began, restoring flexibility, strength, and connection where there was once threat.


  Trauma therapy offers a gradual and respectful path forward. I draw from established approaches such as Accelerated Resolution Therapy, Written Exposure Therapy, and Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, while recognizing that meaningful work happens only when you are ready. There is no rush and no forcing of the nervous system. Progress often unfolds through careful pacing, choice, and gentle exposure to what was once too much to face alone. Over time, many people experience relief in their bodies, greater emotional range, and a renewed sense of agency in their lives. Like the tree, you already possess the capacity to heal. Therapy helps you direct your resources toward that work, at your own pace, in your own way.
