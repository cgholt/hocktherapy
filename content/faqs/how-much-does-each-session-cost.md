question: "How much does each session cost? "
answer: >-
  Each one hour session is $150.


  Many factors go into setting my rates. I keep a small caseload so I can give each client my full attention. Your session isn’t just the hour we spend together — it’s also the time I dedicate to learning, reflecting, and consulting to provide thoughtful, focused therapy. Unlike my experience in insurance-based settings, this practice lets me show up calm, present, and ready to work deeply with what matters to you.
