  Existential therapy is about helping people move from merely getting by to
  actually living. Many people come to therapy feeling stuck, exhausted, or
  disconnected, as if life has narrowed into survival mode. They may be
  functioning on the outside but feel inwardly checked out, resigned, or
  flattened by the demands of life. This work starts from the belief that
  suffering often arises when a person has lost contact with what matters to
  them and with their own capacity to choose how they respond to life.


  In this approach, we focus on how your life is actually experienced from the inside. Rather than breaking you down into symptoms or labels, we work with your emotions, values, history, and current life situations as they are lived. Therapy becomes a space to slow down, listen closely to what your experience is telling you, and understand how past patterns and unexamined attitudes may be shaping the present. The goal is not analysis for its own sake, but clarity. Clarity about what is happening, what is being avoided or endured, and what is asking for a response.


  My role is to help you take an active stance toward your life again. This means learning to tolerate and trust your emotional experience, taking responsibility for your choices, and acting in ways that feel genuine and meaningful to you. Existential therapy is not about fixing you or giving advice, but about helping you reconnect with yourself and the world in a way that feels real. From that place, relief often follows not because life becomes easy, but because it becomes yours again.
