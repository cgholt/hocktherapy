question: "How often should I come to therapy? "
answer: >-
  
  Most clients start with weekly sessions for the first 6–8 weeks. This helps build consistency, momentum, and a foundation for meaningful progress. After that, we can adjust to biweekly or monthly sessions based on your goals, needs, and what feels sustainable. You always have a say in the pace, and together we’ll find a rhythm that works for your life and your process.
