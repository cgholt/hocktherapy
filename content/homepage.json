  "aboutContent": "Therapy with me is practical, honest, and reflective. I work with adults who feel worn down, disconnected, or stuck, often after years of carrying responsibility, stress, or trauma on their own. Many of the people I work with are used to pushing through rather than looking inward. As a U.S. Army veteran, I understand that culture firsthand. Over time, this way of living can lead to numbness, anger, or a quiet loss of self. Personal freedom requires taking a position in your own life, and I help clients do that with clarity, grit, and compassion.\n\nOur work centers on self-responsibility and understanding how past experiences shape present struggles. I help clients face what they’ve been avoiding, reconnect with their values, and respond to life with intention. Much of my work has been with men navigating responsibility and identity, but I work with adults of all backgrounds who want real change.\n\nIf you’re ready to stop reacting to life, understand yourself more deeply, and take intentional steps forward, I invite you to reach out. Many clients appreciate an approach that treats their struggles as understandable responses, not defects. My focus is down-to-earth, principled, and geared toward helping you grow with clarity and resilience.",
