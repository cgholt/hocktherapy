question: What kind of therapy do you offer?
answer: >-
  I work with adults facing a range of life challenges. My approach is
  depth-oriented, existential, and tailored to each person’s unique situation.
  Common areas I support include:


  *  **Existential concerns** – Feeling stuck, disconnected, or uncertain about life’s meaning and purpose.



  *  **Men’s issues** – Navigating identity, masculinity, and purpose in a changing world.



  *  **Trauma & PTSD** – Healing from past experiences that continue to affect your present.



  *  **Anxiety** – Overwhelm, worry, and tension that interfere with daily life.



  *  **Depression** – Low mood, loss of motivation, and emotional numbness.



  *  **First responders** – Coping with high-stress work and the impact of repeated exposure to trauma.



  *  **High-functioning professionals** – Managing stress, burnout, and pressure while maintaining performance.



  *  **Relationship issues** – Challenges in communication, connection, and boundaries (individual therapy only).



  *   **Spirituality** – Exploring meaning, values, and personal belief systems.



  *  **Stress** – Everyday pressures and life demands that feel unmanageable.



  *  **Veterans** – Navigating military experiences, transitions, and their emotional impact.
