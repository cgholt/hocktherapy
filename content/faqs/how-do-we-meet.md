question: "Where and when do we meet? "
answer: >-
  I offer video sessions via a secure telehealth platform to residents of Texas.


  I plan to have in-person services in Houston, TX, in the near future.


  In addition to standard weekday availability, I have a range of early morning, early evening, and weekend slots to cater to your busy lifestyle. I can discuss specific time slots available in your free 15 minute consultation call.
