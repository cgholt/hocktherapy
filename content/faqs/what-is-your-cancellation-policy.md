question: What is your cancellation policy?
answer: >-
  
  I require at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or reschedules. I understand that emergencies happen, and we can discuss together whether a situation qualifies as a true emergency. I keep a credit card on file to hold appointments and ensure that time reserved for you is respected.
