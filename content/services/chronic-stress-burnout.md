  ### Does this sound familiar?


  You’re not falling apart. You’re worn down.


  * You wake up already tired, even after a full night’s sleep.

  * Work feels relentless. No matter how much you do, it never feels like enough.

  * You’re productive, reliable, and capable, yet increasingly numb, detached, or cynical.

  * Small things irritate you more than they used to. Your patience is thinner.

  * You push yourself through obligations, then collapse into distraction, scrolling, drinking, or zoning out.

  * Rest feels unearned, uncomfortable, or impossible. Slowing down makes you more uneasy, not less.

  * You wonder, quietly, how long you can keep going like this.


  Many men experience chronic stress and burnout not as a dramatic breakdown, but as a slow erosion of energy, meaning, and connection to themselves.


  If this resonates, it doesn’t mean you’re weak or broken. It often means you’ve been strong for too long without adequate recovery, reflection, or choice.


  ### Understanding chronic stress and burnout in men


  Chronic stress isn’t just having a lot on your plate. It’s what happens when the nervous system stays in a prolonged state of demand without sufficient rest, meaning, or resolution.


  Burnout often develops when:


  * Responsibility outweighs autonomy

  * Effort is disconnected from purpose

  * Rest is treated as a luxury instead of a necessity

  * Identity becomes fused with productivity or performance


  In men, chronic stress frequently shows up through the body and behavior before it shows up emotionally.


  Common signs include:


  * Persistent fatigue, brain fog, headaches, muscle tension, or gastrointestinal issues

  * Sleep disruption and difficulty fully disengaging

  * Emotional flattening, detachment, or loss of motivation

  * Irritability, impatience, or quiet resentment

  * Increased reliance on caffeine, alcohol, or constant stimulation to get through the day


  Culturally, many men are taught to endure, push through, and carry the load without complaint. Over time, this creates a dangerous split: functioning on the outside while running on empty inside.


  Burnout is not a personal failure. It’s a predictable response to sustained pressure without meaning, limits, or recovery.


  ### A philosophical and existential approach to burnout


  I don’t treat burnout as a diagnosis to manage or a problem to quickly fix.


  From an existential perspective, burnout is a signal. It is a protest from the body and psyche when life becomes unlivable as it’s currently structured.


  Burnout often emerges when a man has lost touch with:


  * His values and sense of direction

  * His freedom to choose how he lives and works

  * His limits, physical, emotional, and existential

  * A felt sense of meaning or agency


  Rather than asking how to cope better, we ask deeper questions:


  * What is this way of living costing me?

  * What am I carrying that isn’t actually mine to carry?

  * What kind of man do I want to be in the face of these demands?


  In therapy, we slow the pace and make space to think, feel, and reflect, often for the first time in a long while. We work with both mind and body, helping your nervous system come out of constant overdrive while also examining the structures, expectations, and beliefs that keep you stuck.


  My work blends practical grounding with philosophical depth. Together, we focus on:


  * Rebuilding a sustainable relationship with work, responsibility, and rest

  * Clarifying values and redefining success on your terms

  * Restoring a sense of agency, choice, and inner authority

  * Developing the courage to set limits and make meaningful changes

  * Helping you feel more alive, present, and oriented again


  Burnout isn’t a sign that you can’t handle life.


  It’s often a sign that life is asking to be handled differently.


  If you’re ready to stop running on empty and start living with more intention, steadiness, and meaning, therapy can be a place to begin.
