question: Do you offer reduced-fee sessions?
answer: >-
  
  Yes—but they are **limited**.


  I partner with **Open Path Psychotherapy Collective** and reserve a small number of slots each week at **$50–$70 per 50-minute session**.



  Open Path is a **nonprofit organization** that connects **uninsured or underinsured individuals** with affordable therapy.


  To access Open Path rates, clients pay a **one-time $65 lifetime membership fee** directly to Open Path (not to me). After that, sessions remain in the reduced-fee range as long as you’re working with an Open Path therapist.
