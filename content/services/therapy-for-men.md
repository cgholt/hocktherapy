  Many men come to therapy feeling disconnected from themselves and from others. You may be functioning well on the outside, meeting responsibilities at work or at home, while internally feeling lonely, anxious, irritable, or emotionally flat. From an early age, boys and men are often socialized to be solution-focused and self-reliant, which can make it difficult to recognize emotional needs or ask for support. Over time, this can lead to isolation, relationship strain, suppressed anger, and a quiet sense of disorientation or despair. These struggles are common among men, and they deserve to be taken seriously.


  Much of this pain is tied to confusion about masculinity in the modern world. As outdated and harmful models of masculinity are rightly questioned, many men are left without a clear, life-affirming alternative. In my work, we explore *tonic masculinity*, an approach that understands masculinity as a set of virtues grounded in presence, responsibility, courage, and integrity. An antidote to "toxic" masculinity. Rather than shaming masculine energy or denying it, tonic masculinity helps men inhabit it consciously and ethically. Masculinity is not the problem. When lived with awareness and virtue, it can be a powerful force for connection, protection, creativity, and meaning.


  Men today are facing real and pressing issues, including rising loneliness, suicide risk, emotional disconnection, and the loss of meaningful male spaces. Many men experience anxiety through tension, restlessness, irritability, or overwork rather than through worry alone. Others struggle with identity shifts related to fatherhood, relationships, or changing cultural expectations. Therapy with a male therapist who understands these realities offers a place to speak honestly, reflect deeply, and reconnect with yourself and with other men in meaningful ways. This work is not about fixing what is broken, but about reclaiming what has been neglected and learning how to live with strength, depth, and purpose.
