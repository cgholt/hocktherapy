  "aboutContent": "I'm a licensed therapist specializing in men's mental health. I help men navigate the unique challenges they face—whether it's relationship struggles, career pressure, anger, anxiety, or the search for meaning and purpose.\n\nMy approach draws from existential analysis, focusing on the fundamental questions of existence: meaning, responsibility, freedom, and connection. This isn't about fixing what's broken—it's about building a life that feels authentic and worth living.\n\nMany men are taught to suppress emotions and handle everything alone. Therapy offers a different path: a space to think clearly, speak honestly, and develop the tools to face life's challenges with strength and clarity.",
