question: Can I use my health insurance?
answer: >-
  I do not participate in insurance panels, however, I've partnered with
  Mentaya, a service that streamlines getting reimbursed for your therapy
  sessions through out-of-network benefits.


  \    


  \    Mentaya is perfect if you:


  \    • Have out-of-network benefits


  \    • Feel overwhelmed by superbills and insurance


  \    • Have submitted superbills but failed to get any reimbursement


  \    • Simply want to skip the hassle of paperwork!


  \    


  \    Here's how it works:


  \    1. Sign up for Mentaya: https://mentaya.co/inviteclient/EJyvpi4M9g57xhPWXlTB


  \    2. I will enter your sessions into the platform.


  \    3. Mentaya submits the claim and handles any insurance follow-up.


  \    4. You get reimbursed by insurance!




  \    Mentaya charges a 5% fee per claim, which includes handling any paperwork required,


  \    dealing with denials, and calling insurance companies.


  \    


  \    It's risk-free: They guarantee claims are successfully submitted, or a full refund of their fees.
